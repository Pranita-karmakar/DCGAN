## DCGAN
DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). DCGAN is a type of generative model that uses deep convolutional neural networks to generate new data, often used for tasks like image synthesis.I am building a model forgenerating realistic images, including handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset used for training and evaluating machine learning models, especially in the field of computer vision.
